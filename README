I made the first two pages for a brewery called Penrose Brewery. I figured each brewery will have their own design project folder here.

Controllers folder will have php files that essentially define our API-one to interact with orders, one to interact with customer info, etc so code is easy to track down. 

Views will have any raw SQL setup type stuff (defining tables, initializing data, etc)

I suggest making a local copy of this project to try and view it. There are a lot of include files for the design. Once things are functioning better we can just each use our own private domains as test areas to develop in.
